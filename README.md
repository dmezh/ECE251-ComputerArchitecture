# ECE251-ComputerArchitecture

Projects and other files from ECE251 Computer Architecture (Spring 2020) at Cooper Union.

- Project 1: String concatenator
- Project 2: Number sort
- Project 3: PEDMAS calculator

Mostly ARMv7 assembly with C testing/support files. 
 _Note:_ Some of the C might look a little odd - I wrote it as planning and test code for the assembly, so you will see conditions split in a certain way, etc. Individual project folders have READMEs of their own.
